Here's a binary tree problem that combines various traversal techniques similar to the tasks of finding the maximum value, printing leaves, branches, and the root:

### Problem:
Given a binary tree, perform the following operations:
1. **Find the minimum value** in the binary tree.
2. **Print all the nodes at a given depth** in the tree.
3. **Print the leftmost and rightmost nodes** at each level.
4. **Print the sum of all the nodes** in the tree.

### Input:
The root of a binary tree.

### Example:

```plaintext
        10
      /    \
     5      20
    / \    /  \
   3   7  15  25
```

### Output:
- **Minimum value**: 3
- **Nodes at depth 2**: 3, 7, 15, 25
- **Leftmost and Rightmost nodes at each level**:
  - Level 0: 10
  - Level 1: 5, 20
  - Level 2: 3, 25
- **Sum of all nodes**: 85
